                        <h1>Types of Technology</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Communication Technology.</li>
                            <li> Business Technology.</li>
                            <li> Robotics Technology.</li>
                            <li>Artificial Intelligence.</li>
                            <li>Information Technology</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Technology's main function is to bring about change and to show how that change affects society and enterprises. Many people feel future shock when technological advances occur at such a rapid pace that they are unable to handle or tolerate the shift, as well as the repercussions.When it came to coping with the internet, tablets, and cellphones, for example, the older generation was taken aback. Some even fought the transition by refusing to incorporate new technologies into their daily lives, despite the fact that it would make their lives easier.</p>

                        <h1>Positive Impact Of Technology.</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Improving Strategies :    As a result of technological advancements, business methods have tremendously developed and improved. Technology has dramatically enhanced one of the most basic aspects of running a business: the hiring process. It wasn't long ago that companies had very few options when it comes to employing new personnel.
                           </li>
                            <li>Accurate Statistics  : Technology has made it easier to collect and analyze large volumes of data to aid in decision-making, as well as to share findings with others in your company at any time.</li>

                            <li>Easier Communication :  The phone used to be the primary mode of communication in the not-too-distant past. You'd need a secretary to keep track of your schedule, and you'd have to trust that you wouldn't get stuck playing phone tag with a pressing deadline approaching.</li>

                            <li>  Smoother Trade :  Transactions are far simpler and more efficient now than they were previously. On the consumer side, innovations such as the credit card and the rise of e-commerce have made it easier than ever for firms to sell items and services to customers when and when they want them. On a B2B level, however, transactions are significantly easier on a large scale.          </li>
                            <li>Impact on Advertising : Companies with the ability to promote online have a significant edge over those who use more traditional means. With the correct plan, you can now expose your brand to a global audience on the internet, which was previously unattainable unless your organization had a large budget. You may also utilize your website to provide consumers with brand-related material and communicate directly with them on social media, enhancing your brand's identity and increasing its reputation and recognition.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p></p>

                        <h1>Negative Impact of Technology</h1>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Physical effects : The negative effects of technology on children's physical health are arguably the easiest to quantify of all the negative effects of technology. Metabolic illnesses due by sedentary lifestyles fostered by technology usage have been the most widely cited health effect of technology use. Sitting with a digital gadget not only reduces the amount of physical activity needed to keep fit, but it also encourages increased snacking, all of which leads to obesity, among other problems.
</li>
                            <li>Mental effects : Technology addiction is a major mental health problem that is brought on by the use/abuse of digital tools, and it has the potential to harm a child's health and social life, as well as social and familial ties. Chronic Smartphone Stress is a relatively recent condition associated with digital usage, in which continual notifications and interactions with digital tools create new stress-fear memory pathways in the brain.</li>
                            <li>Social effect : Humans are sociable animals who have lived in social groupings for millennia. The social recluse has always been the exception rather than the rule, until the Internet and social media, which were designed to bring people together but instead have physically segregated us.</li>
                            <li>Effect On Education: While the seemingly limitless amount of knowledge available on the internet appears to be beneficial to education, it appears that it has not made a significant contribution to the cause of education. Because knowledge is readily available, there is an overuse of technology in the classroom, which plainly has a detrimental impact on the learning process. In addition to encouraging plagiarism and cheating in the classroom, over use of technology and the Internet has harmed analytical and critical thinking skills.</li>
                            <li>Open communication : It is critical to discuss the risks and perils of cyberspace with your child. With rights come duties, and the youngster must understand the ramifications of irresponsible behavior and gadget abuse.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> Technology is becoming an inextricable part of our daily lives, and it plays a significant role in our mental and physical well-being â€” it's no longer "I think, therefore I am," but rather "I digitize, therefore I am." While technology provides our children with a new and limitless source of information and knowledge, as well as a borderless method of contact, its negative implications cannot be understated. Let's look at some of the most prevalent effects of technology on children's and teenagers' physical and mental health, education, and social lives.</p>
