                    <p style="margin-left: 5rem; margin-top: 3rem; font-size: 20px;">The usability of two Web page layouts was directly compared: one with the main site navigation menu on the left side of the page, and the other with the main site navigation menu on the right side of the page. Sixty-four individuals were randomly allocated to one of two conditions: left-hand navigation or right-hand navigation. The time it took to complete each of the five tasks was measured using a stopwatch. The assumption that left-hand navigation would be substantially faster than right-hand navigation was disproved.</p>

They have a big database of website search ranks. They also make it simple to figure out which phrases drive traffic and their potential. It's not uncommon to have a single page, such as those mentioned above, rank for hundreds (or even thousands) of related keywords. Concentrating on improving a better version of a top-performing page rather than a particular keyword or phrase can be far more efficient in terms of ranking.</p>

[2] For dynamic activity, many web pages utilize JavaScript code, and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) code for presentation semantics.
